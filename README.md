# Memory-management
Documenting some knowledge of memory management
## The Process Memory Model
Each program is assigned its own virtual memory by the operating system. This address space is arranged in a linear fashion with one block of data being stored at each address. It is also divided into several distinct areas as illustrated by the figure below:
![memory layer](c21-fig1.png)
The last address 0cFFFFFFFF converts to the decimal 4.294.967.295 , which is the total amount of memory blocks that can theoretically addressed in a 32 bit operating system - hence the well-known limit of 4GB of memory. On a 64 bit system, the available space is significantly (!) larger. Also, the addresses are stored with 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes.
The blocks "OS Kernel Space" and "Text" are reserved for the operating system. In kernel space, only the most trusted code is executed - it is fully maintained by the operating system and serves as an interface between the user code and the system kernel. The section called 'text' holds the program code generated by the compiler and linker. The remaining blocks, starting from the top:
  - The **stack** is a contiguous memory block with a fixed maximum size. If a program exceeds this size, it will crash. The stack is used for storing automatically allocated variables such as local variables or function parameters. If there are multiple threads in a program, then each thread has its own stack memory. New memory on the stack is allocated when the path of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left. It is important to know that the stack is managed "automatically" by the compiler, which means we do not have to concern ourselves with allocation and deallocation.
  - The **heap** (also called "free store" in C++) is where data with dynamic storage lives. It is shared among multiple threads in a program, which means that memory management for the heap needs to take concurrency into account. This makes memory allocations in the heap more complicated than stack allocations. In general, managing memory on the heap is more (computationally) expensive for the operating system, which makes it slower than stack memory. Contrary to the stack, the heap is not managed automatically by the system, but by the programmer. If memory is allocated on the heap, it is the programmerâ€™s responsibility to free it again when it is no longer needed. If the programmer manages the heap poorly or not at all, there will be trouble.
  - The **BSS** (Block Started by Symbol) segment is used in many compilers and linkers for a segment that contains global and static variables that are initialized with zero values. This memory area is suitable, for example, for arrays that are not initialized with predefined values.
  - The **Data** segment serves the same purpose as the BSS segment with the major difference being that variables in the Data segment have been initialized with a value other than zero. Memory for variables in the Data segment (and in BSS) is allocated once when a program is run and persists throughout its lifetime.
## Memory Allocation in C++
Now that we have an understanding of the available process memory, let us take a look at memory allocation in C++.
Not every variable in a program has a permanently assigned area of memory. The term allocate refers to the process of assigning an area of memory to a variable to store its value. A variable is deallocated when the system reclaims the memory from the variable, so it no longer has an area to store its value.
Generally, three basic types of memory allocation are supported:
1. **Static memory allocation** is performed for static and global variables, which are stored in the BSS and Data segment. Memory for these types of variables is allocated once when your program is run and persists throughout the life of your program.
2. **Automatic memory allocation** is performed for function parameters as well as local variables, which are stored on the stack. Memory for these types of variables is allocated when the path of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left.
3. **Dynamic memory allocation** is a possibility for programs to request memory from the operating system at runtime when needed. This is the major difference between automatic and static allocation, where the size of the variable must be known at compile time. Dynamic memory allocation is not performed on the limited stack but on the heap and is thus (almost) only limited by the size of the address space.
## Properties of Stack Memory
As mentioned in the last section, the stack is the place in virtual memory where the local variables reside, including arguments to functions. Each time a function is called, the stack grows (from top to bottom) and each time a function returns, the stack contracts. When using multiple threads (as in concurrent programming), it is important to know that each thread has its own stack memory - which can be considered thread-safe.
In the following, a short list of key properties of the stack is listed:
1. The stack is a **contiguous block of memory**. It will not become fragmented (as opposed to the heap) and it has a fixed maximum size.
2. When the **maximum size of the stack** memory is exceeded, a program will crash.
3. Allocating and deallocating **memory is fast** on the stack. It only involves moving the stack pointer to a new position.
![stack memory](c22-fig1.png)
## Variable Scopes in C++
The time between allocation and deallocation is called the lifetime of a variable. Using a variable after its lifetime has ended is a common programming error, against which most modern languages try to protect: Local variables are only available within their respective scope (e.g. inside a function) and are simply not available outside - so using them inappropriately will result in a compile-time error. When using pointer variables however, programmers must make sure that allocation is handled correctly and that no invalid memory addresses are accessed.
For the allocation of local variables, the following holds:
1.  Memory is allocated for local variables only after a function has been called. The parameters of a function are also local variables and they are initialized with a value copied from the caller.
2.  As long as the current thread of execution is within function `A`, memory for the local variables remains allocated. This even holds true in case another function `B` is called from within the current function `A` and the thread of execution moves into this nested function call. However, within function `B`, the local variables of function `A` are not known.
3.  When the function exits, its locals are deallocated and there is now way to them afterwards - even if the address were still known (e.g. by storing it within a pointer).
## Passing Variables by Value
```
//pass_by_value.cpp
void AddTwo(int val)
{
    val += 2;
}

int main()
{
    int val = 0;
    AddTwo(val);
    val += 2;

    std::cout << "val = " << val << std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
```
Consider the example on the right in the `pass_by_value.cpp` file. In main, the integer `val` is initialized with 0. When passing it to the function `AddTwo`, a local copy of `val` is created, which only exists within the scope of `AddTwo`, so the add-operation has no effect on `val` on the caller side. So when `main` returns, `val` has a value of 2
There are two major downsides to this:
1. Passing parameters by value means that a copy is created, which is an expensive operation that might consume large amounts of memory, depending on the data that is being transferred. Later in this course we will encounter "move semantics", which is an effective way to compensate for this downside.
2. Passing by value also means that the created copy can not be used as a back channel for communicating with the caller, for example by directly writing the desired information into the variable.
With a slight modification, we can easily create a backchannel to the caller side.
```
#include <iostream>

void AddThree(int *val)
{
    *val += 3;
}

int main()
{
    int val = 0;
    AddThree(&val);
    val += 2;

    std::cout << "val = " << val << std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
```
In this case, when passing the parameter to the function `AddThree`, we are creating a local copy as well but note that we are now passing a pointer variable. This means that a copy of the memory address of `val` is created, which we can then use to directly modify its content by using the dereference operator `*`.
## Passing Variables by Reference
The second major way of passing parameters to a function is by reference. With this way, the function receives a reference to the parameter, rather than a copy of its value. As with the example of `AddThree` above, the function can now modify the argument such that the changes also happen on the caller side. In addition to the possibility to directly exchange information between function and caller, passing variables by reference is also faster as no information needs to be copied, as well as more memory-efficient.
A major disadvantage is that the caller does not always know what will happen to the data it passes to a function (especially when the function code can not be modified easily). Thus, in some cases, special steps must be taken to protect ones data from inappropriate modification.
To pass a variable by reference, we simply declare the function parameters as references using `&` rather than as normal variables. When the function is called, `val` will become a reference to the argument. Since a reference to a variable is treated exactly the same as the variable itself, any changes made to the reference are passed through to the argument!
```
#include <iostream>

void AddFour(int &val)
{
    val += 4;
}

int main()
{
    int val = 0;
    AddFour(val);
    val += 2;

    std::cout << "val = " << val << std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
```
## Pointers vs. References
If passing by value needs to be avoided, both pointers and references are a way to achieve this. The following selection of properties contrasts the two methods so it will be easier to decide which to use from the perspective of the use-case at hand:
- Pointers can be declared without initialization. This means we can pass an uninitialized pointer to a function who then internally performs the initialization for us.
- Pointers can be reassigned to another memory block on the heap.
- References are usually easier to use (depending on the expertise level of the programmer). Sometimes however, if a third-party function is used without properly looking at the parameter definition, it might go unnoticed that a value has been modified.
## Overview of memory management problems
1. **Memory Leaks** Memory leaks occur when data is allocated on the heap at runtime, but not properly deallocated. A program that forgets to clear a memory block is said to have a memory leak - this may be a serious problem or not, depending on the circumstances and on the nature of the program. For a program that runs, computes something, and quits immediately, memory leaks are usually not a big concern. Memory leaks are mostly problematic for programs that run for a long time and/or use large data structures. In such a case, memory leaks can gradually fill the heap until allocation requests can no longer be properly met and the program stops responding or crashes completely. We will look at an example further down in this section.

2. **Buffer Overruns** Buffer overruns occur when memory outside the allocated limits is overwritten and thus corrupted. One of the resulting problems is that this effect may not become immediately visible. When a problem finally does occur, cause and effect are often hard to discern. It is also sometimes possible to inject malicious code into programs in this way, but this shall not be discussed here.

In this example, the allocated stack memory is too small to hold the entire string, which results in a segmentation fault:
```
char str[5];
strcpy(str,"BufferOverrun");
printf("%s",str);
```
3. **Uninitialized Memory** Depending on the C++ compiler, data structures are sometimes initialized (most often to zero) and sometimes not. So when allocating memory on the heap without proper initialization, it might sometimes contain garbage that can cause problems.

Generally, a variable will be automatically initialized in these cases:
- it is a class instance where the default constructor initializes all primitive types
- array initializer syntax is used, such as int a[10] = {}
- it is a global or extern variable
- it is defined static
The behavior of the following code is potentially undefined:
```
int a;
int b=a*42;
printf("%d",b);
```
4. **Incorrect pairing of allocation and deallocation** Freeing a block of memory more than once will cause a program to crash. This can happen when a block of memory is freed that has never been allocated or has been freed before. Such behavior could also occur when improper pairings of allocation and deallocation are used such as using `malloc()` with `delete` or `new` with `free()`.
In this first example, the wrong new and delete are paired
```
double *pDbl=new double[5];
delete pDbl;
```
In this second example, the pairing is correct but a double deletion is performed:
```
char *pChr=new char[5];
delete[] pChr;
delete[] pChr;
```
5. **Invalid memory access*** This error occurs then trying to access a block of heap memory that has not yet or has already been deallocated.
In this example, the heap memory has already been deallocated at the time when strcpy() tries to access it:
```
char *pStr=new char[25];
delete[] pStr;
strcpy(pStr, "Invalid Access");
```
## Default copying
In C++, a common way of safely accessing resources is by wrapping a manager class around the handle, which is initialized when the resource is acquired (in the class constructor) and released when it is deleted (in the class destructor). This concept is often referred to as Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII), which we will discuss in greater depth in the next concept. One problem with this approach though is that copying the manager object will also copy the handle of the resource. This allows two objects access to the same resource - and this can mean trouble.
```
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
private:
    int *_myInt;

public:
    MyClass()
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    };
    ~MyClass()
    {
        free(_myInt);
    };
    void printOwnAddress() { std::cout << "Own address on the stack is " << this << std::endl; }
    void printMemberAddress() { std::cout << "Managing memory block on the heap at " << _myInt << std::endl; }
};

int main()
{
    // instantiate object 1
    MyClass myClass1;
    myClass1.printOwnAddress();
    myClass1.printMemberAddress();

    // copy object 1 into object 2
    MyClass myClass2(myClass1); // copy constructor
    myClass2.printOwnAddress();
    myClass2.printMemberAddress();

    return 0;
}
```
The class MyClass has a private member, which is a pointer to a heap-allocated integer. Allocation is performed in the constructor, deallocation is done in the destructor. This means that the memory block of size sizeof(int) is allocated when the objects myClass1 and myClass2 are created on the stack and deallocated when their scope is left, which happens at the end of the main. The difference between myClass1 and myClass2 is that the latter is instantiated using the copy constructor, which duplicates the members in myClass1 - including the pointer to the heap memory where _myInt resides.
The output of the program looks like the following:
```
Own address on the stack is 0x7ffeefbff670
Managing memory block on the heap at 0x100300060
Own address on the stack is 0x7ffeefbff658
Managing memory block on the heap at 0x100300060
copy_constructor_1(87582,0x1000a95c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x100300060: pointer being freed was not allocated
```
Note that in the workspace, the error will read:
```
*** Error in './a.out': double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x0000000001133c20 ***
```
From the output we can see that the stack address is different for `myClass1` and `myClass2` - as was expected. The address of the managed memory block on the heap however is identical. This means that when the first object goes out of scope, it releases the memory resource by calling `free` in its destructor. The second object does the same - which causes the program to crash as the pointer is now referencing an invalid area of memory, which has already been freed.
The default behavior of both copy constructor and assignment operator is to perform a shallow copy as with the example above. The following figure illustrates the concept:
![C41-FIG1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28687425/201520054-fc1879d7-7303-4820-a69c-09213025c456.png)
Fortunately, in C++, the copying process can be controlled by defining a tailored copy constructor as well as a copy assignment operator. The copying process must be closely linked to the respective resource release mechanism and is often referred to as copy-ownership policy. Tailoring the copy constructor according to your memory management policy is an important choice you often need to make when designing a class.
## No copying policy
The simplest policy of all is to forbid copying and assigning class instances all together. This can be achieved by declaring, but not defining a private copy constructor and assignment operator (see `NoCopyClass1` below) or alternatively by making both public and assigning the `delete` operator (see `NoCopyClass2` below). The second choice is more explicit and makes it clearer to the programmer that copying has been actively forbidden. Let us have a look at a code example on the right that illustrates both cases.
```
class NoCopyClass1
{
private:
    NoCopyClass1(const NoCopyClass1 &);
    NoCopyClass1 &operator=(const NoCopyClass1 &);

public:
    NoCopyClass1(){};
};

class NoCopyClass2
{
public:
    NoCopyClass2(){}
    NoCopyClass2(const NoCopyClass2 &) = delete;
    NoCopyClass2 &operator=(const NoCopyClass2 &) = delete;
};

int main()
{
    NoCopyClass1 original1;
    NoCopyClass1 copy1a(original1); // copy câ€™tor
    NoCopyClass1 copy1b = original1; // assigment operator

    NoCopyClass2 original2;
    NoCopyClass2 copy2a(original2); // copy câ€™tor
    NoCopyClass2 copy2b = original2; // assigment operator

    return 0;
}
```
On compiling, we get the following error messages:
```
error: calling a private constructor of class 'NoCopyClass1'
    NoCopyClass1 copy1(original1);
    NoCopyClass1 copy1b = original1; 

error: call to deleted constructor of 'NoCopyClass2'
    NoCopyClass2 copy2(original2);
    NoCopyClass2 copy2b = original2; 
```
Both cases effectively prevent the original object from being copied or assigned. In the C++11 standard library, there are some classes for multi-threaded synchronization which use the no copying policy.
## Exclusive ownership policy
This policy states that whenever a resource management object is copied, the resource handle is transferred from the source pointer to the destination pointer. In the process, the source pointer is set to `nullptr` to make ownership exclusive. At any time, the resource handle belongs only to a single object, which is responsible for its deletion when it is no longer needed.
```
#include <iostream>

class ExclusiveCopy
{
private:
    int *_myInt;

public:
    ExclusiveCopy()
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        std::cout << "resource allocated" << std::endl;
    }
    ~ExclusiveCopy()
    {
        if (_myInt != nullptr)
        {
            free(_myInt);
            std::cout << "resource freed" << std::endl;
        }
            
    }
    ExclusiveCopy(ExclusiveCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = source._myInt;
        source._myInt = nullptr;
    }
    ExclusiveCopy &operator=(ExclusiveCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = source._myInt;
        source._myInt = nullptr;
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    ExclusiveCopy source;
    ExclusiveCopy destination(source);

    return 0;
}
```
As can be seen, only a single resource is allocated and freed. So by passing handles and invalidating them, we can implement a basic version of an exclusive ownership policy. However, this example is not the way exclusive ownership is handled in the standard template library. One problem in this implementation is that for a short time there are effectively two valid handles to the same resource - after the handle has been copied and before it is set to `nullptr`. In concurrent programs, this would cause a data race for the resource. A much better alternative to handle exclusive ownership in C++ would be to use move semantics.

## Deep copying policy
With this policy, copying and assigning class instances to each other is possible without the danger of resource conflicts. The idea is to allocate proprietary memory in the destination object and then to copy the content to which the source object handle is pointing into the newly allocated block of memory. This way, the content is preserved during copy or assignment. However, this approach increases the memory demands and the uniqueness of the data is lost: After the deep copy has been made, two versions of the same resource exist in memory.
The deep-copy version of MyClass looks similar to the exclusive ownership policy: Both the assignment operator and the copy constructor have been overloaded with the source object passed by reference. But instead of copying the source handle (and then deleting it), a proprietary block of memory is allocated on the heap and the content of the source is copied into it.
```
#include <iostream>

class DeepCopy
{
private:
    int *_myInt;

public:
    DeepCopy(int val)
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        *_myInt = val;
        std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
    }
    ~DeepCopy()
    {
        free(_myInt);
        std::cout << "resource freed at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
    }
    DeepCopy(DeepCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        *_myInt = *source._myInt;
        std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << " with _myInt = " << *_myInt << std::endl;
    }
    DeepCopy &operator=(DeepCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << " with _myInt=" << *_myInt << std::endl;
        *_myInt = *source._myInt;
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    DeepCopy source(42);
    DeepCopy dest1(source);
    DeepCopy dest2 = dest1;

    return 0;
}
```
The output of the program looks like the following:
```
resource allocated at address 0x100300060
resource allocated at address 0x100300070 with _myInt = 42
resource allocated at address 0x100300080 with _myInt = 42
resource freed at address 0x100300080
resource freed at address 0x100300070
resource freed at address 0x100300060
```
As can be seen, all copies have the same value of 42 while the address of the handle differs between `source`, `dest1` and `dest2`.
To conclude, the following figure illustrates the idea of a deep copy:
![C41-FIG2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28687425/201520346-09cd96b7-ea12-4103-85a5-6d8e8c7277e3.png)
## Shared ownership policy
The last ownership policy we will be discussing in this course implements a shared ownership behavior. The idea is to perform a copy or assignment similar to the default behavior, i.e. copying the handle instead of the content (as with a shallow copy) while at the same time keeping track of the number of instances that also point to the same resource. Each time an instance goes out of scope, the counter is decremented. Once the last object is about to be deleted, it can safely deallocate the memory resource. We will see that this is the central idea of `unique_ptr`, which is a representative of the group of smart pointers.
```
#include <iostream>

class SharedCopy
{
private:
    int *_myInt;
    static int _cnt;

public:
    SharedCopy(int val);
    ~SharedCopy();
    SharedCopy(SharedCopy &source);
};

int SharedCopy::_cnt = 0;

SharedCopy::SharedCopy(int val)
{
    _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *_myInt = val;
    ++_cnt;
    std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
}

SharedCopy::~SharedCopy()
{
    --_cnt;
    if (_cnt == 0)
    {
        free(_myInt);
        std::cout << "resource freed at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "instance at address " << this << " goes out of scope with _cnt = " << _cnt << std::endl;
    }
}

SharedCopy::SharedCopy(SharedCopy &source)
{
    _myInt = source._myInt;
    ++_cnt;
    std::cout << _cnt << " instances with handles to address " << _myInt << " with _myInt = " << *_myInt << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    SharedCopy source(42);
    SharedCopy destination1(source);
    SharedCopy destination2(source);
    SharedCopy destination3(source);

    return 0;
}
```
## The Rule of Three
In the previous examples we have taken a first look at several copying policies:
Default copying
No copying
Exclusive ownership
Deep copying
Shared ownership
In the first example we have seen that the default implementation of the copy constructor does not consider the "special" needs of a class which allocates and deallocates a shared resource on the heap. The problem with implicitly using the default copy constructor or assignment operator is that programmers are not forced to consider the implications for the memory management policy of their program. In the case of the first example, this leads to a segmentation fault and thus a program crash.
In order to properly manage memory allocation, deallocation and copying behavior, we have seen that there is an intricate relationship between destructor, copy constructor and copy assignment operator. To this end, the Rule of Three states that if a class needs to have an overloaded copy constructor, copy assignment operator, ~or~ destructor, then it must also implement the other two as well to ensure that memory is managed consistently. As we have seen, the copy constructor and copy assignment operator (which are often almost identical) control how the resource gets copied between objects while the destructor manages the resource deletion.
You may have noted that in the previous code example, the class SharedCopy does not implement the assignment operator. This is a violation of the Rule of Three and thus, if we were to use something like destination3 = source instead of SharedCopy destination3(source), the counter variable would not be properly decremented.

## What are lvalues and rvalues?
A good grasp of lvalues and rvalues in C++ is essential for understanding the more advanced concepts of rvalue references and motion semantics.

Let us start by stating that every expression in C++ has a type and belongs to a value category. When objects are created, copied or moved during the evaluation of an expression, the compiler uses these value expressions to decide which method to call or which operator to use.

Prior to C++11, there were only two value categories, now there are as many as five of them:
![C42-FIG1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28687425/201520864-b6e957ef-e5bc-4a6f-8371-ba98bb0396ae.png)

To keep it short, we do not want to go into all categories, but limit ourselves to lvalues and prvalues:

- Lvalues have an address that can be accessed. They are expressions whose evaluation by the compiler determines the identity of objects or functions.

- Prvalues do not have an address that is accessible directly. They are temporary expressions used to initialize objects or compute the value of the operand of an operator.
```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int i = 1; 
    int j = 2; 
    int k = i + j; 
    int &&l = i + j; 

    std::cout << "k = " << k << ", l = " << l << std::endl;

    return 0; 
}
```
After creating the integers `i` and `j` on the stack, the sum of both is added to a third integer `k`. Let us examine this simple example a little more closely. In the first and second assignment, `i` and `j` are created as lvalues, while `1` and `2` are rvalues, whose value is copied into the memory location of `i` and `j`. Then, a third lvalue, `k`, is created. The sum `i+j` is created as an rvalue, which holds the result of the addition before being copied into the memory location of `k`. This is quite a lot of copying and holding of temporary values in memory. With an rvalue reference, this can be done more efficiently.

The expression `int &&l` creates an rvalue reference, to which the address of the temporary object is assigned, that holds the result of the addition. So instead of first creating the rvalue `i+j` , then copying it and finally deleting it, we can now hold the temporary object in memory. This is much more efficient than the first approach, even though saving a few bytes of storage in the example might not seem like much at first glance. One of the most important aspects of rvalue references is that they pave the way for move semantics, which is a mighty technique in modern C++ to optimize memory usage and processing speed. Move semantics and rvalue references make it possible to write code that transfers resources such as dynamically allocated memory from one object to another in a very efficient manner and also supports the concept of exclusive ownership, as we will shortly see when discussing smart pointers. In the next section we will take a close look at move semantics and its benefits for memory management.
